# ðŸŒ¿PlantShelf  
PlantShelf is a webpage which shows image/information cards for different plants.

In these 2 lessons, you will:  
* Explore and modify the structure (HTML) and style (CSS) of PlantShelf.  
* Learn to use GitHub and git to back up and version-control your code.

## JS  

### Syntax  
#### variables  
```
// Declare num and set it to 42
let num = 42;

// Change value in num to 9
num = 9;
```

#### functions  
```
// Declare function
function toggleDarkMode() {
  let body = document.querySelector("body");
  body.classList.toggle("darkmode");
}
// Call function
toggleDarkMode();
```

#### forEach  
```
[1, 2, 3, 4]
```

#### Nesting
CSS rules can be nested to reduce repetition. For example, this:
```
header h1 {
  ...
}
header nav {
  ...
}
```

...can be rewritten as this:
```
header {
  h1 {
    ...
  }

  nav {
    ...
  }
}
```

<br/>

#### Variables  
Variables (a.k.a. *custom properties*) can be used in CSS to store and use values:
```
nav {
  --accent-color: gold;
  color: var(--accent-color);
}
```

A variable must be declared inside a rule (i.e. inside a `<selector> { ... }` block). Variables can be accessed inside the rule where they're created (like above), and they "cascade" just like normal properties. For example, `nav button` can also access `--accent-color`:

```
nav button {
  border: 2px solid var(--accent-color);
}
```

A common trick to make a variable accessible *everywhere* is to declare it inside the "fake" `:root` selector.

##### âœ… Activity   
- [ ] Change the colours assigned to the variables inside the `:root` selector in `style.css`

#### Relative units and responsive typography
As well as the page colours, the `:root` selector declares variables for the width and height of the cards:
```
:root {
  ...
  --card-width: 11rem;
  --card-height: 16rem;
}
```
Unlike pixels (`px`), which sets an exact size, a `rem` is a *relative* unit. Specifically, `11rem` means `11 x <whatever the root element's font-size is>`, a.k.a. `11 x <the html element's font-size>`.  

If you look at the rest of the style.css, you'll see that exact sizes aren't used at all. This means that if we want to scale everything on the page, all we have to do is change one value: the html element's `font-size`.

So what is the html element's `font-size`? It depends how big the window is:
```
html {
  font-size: clamp(10px, 1.6vw, 16px);
}
```

The `clamp` function says "make `font-size` `1.6 x <the window width>`" â€” but no less than `10px` and no more than `16px`. The result is that everything on the page scales based on the window size, so the website also looks sensible on a phone screen:

##### âœ… Activity   
- [ ] Modify the arguments of the `clamp` function in style.css to change minimum and maximum scale of the page. Resize your browser window to test it out.

#### flex and grid layouts
You may have used the `display` property before to make elements either stack on top of each other (`display: block`) or sit next to each other (`display: inline`).

Two other common `display` values are `flex` and `grid`, which are recent inventions intended to make laying out pages easier. There is a lot to say about both, but a very brief summary is:  

* if an element has `display: flex` set, its elements will grow and shrink based on the available space. For example, these rules mean that the `header`, `main`, and `footer` elements are stacked in a column fills the entire screen height. The `main` element expands to make sure this happens:
    ```
    body {
      display: flex;
      ...
      flex-direction: column;
      min-height: 100vh;
      ...

      main {
        flex: 1;
      }
    }
    ```

* if an element has `display: grid` set, its elements will be arranged in rows and colums. For example, these rules mean that the cards will be arranged in a grid with `1rem` of space between rows and columns, and with the number of columns depending on how much room there is:
    ```
    .container {
      ....
      display: grid;
      grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(var(--card-width), 1fr));
      gap: 1rem;
    }
    ```

 flex-direction (column vs row)   

##### âœ… Activity   
- [ ] Change `flex-direction: column;` to `flex-direction: row;`, and explain what happens as a result.  
- [ ] Double the size of the grid `gap`.

## [optional] Card flipping extension
* In  index.html, uncomment all the `<div class="back side">` sections.  
* Also in index.html, link the additional `flip_extension.css` stylesheet.  
* What happens now when you hover over a card?  
* Investigate the TODOs in `flip_extension.css` and try to make the cards flip.  

## [optional] Further information and useful tools
#### Visual Studio Code â”‚ Live Server extension
* Search and install the Live Server extension (View > Open View... Extensions).  
* Inside your index.html, right click and select "Open with Live Server". A new browser tab should open with your page, and will automatically reload whenever you save a change to the html or css (so you no longer have to refresh!)
